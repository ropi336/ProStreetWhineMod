PROSTREET Whine Mod. Â© ropsli No Rights Reserved.

Tool allowing users to permanently force Gearbox whine either for ALL cars or for cars of their choosing. 

Unfortunately, it does not fix the bug that causes whine sound to disappear after running a drag race. When this happens, you must quit to main menu and reload the raceday. (This is also a bug in the vanilla game.)

Requirements:
A DLL ASI loader.
