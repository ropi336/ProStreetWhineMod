With this handy tool, you will now be able to PERMANENTLY FORCE Gearbox whine either for ALL cars or for cars of your choosing. This also fixes the infamous car whine sound disappearing randomly after you do a certain number of races on a raceday (or whatever else can cause this idk)

Usage:
Place ProStreetGearWhine.ini and ProStreetGearWhine.asi into the scripts folder, found in your Game Installation directory.
It is required to RESTART THE GAME when you make edits to the ini file.

Fill the ProStreetGearWhine.ini CarList parameter with the cars you want, or type ALL to force gear whine for every vehicle in the game.
The list of cars must adhere to the ingame name of the car. (e.g BMWM3 for the BMW E46 M3, MCLARENF1 for the Mclaren F1, COROLLA for the Toyota Corolla, ETC.). Car names must be separated by COMMA " , " SPACES ARE NOT ALLOWED.
For a full list of cars, just look in the CARS folder found in your ProStreet Game Installation folder. 

An example of a ProStreetGearWhine.ini that will force whine for the following cars: BMW E46 M3, 240SX, Nissan 350Z, looks like this:

[Gameplay]
CarList=BMWM3,240SX,350Z

Requirements:
A DLL ASI loader.
